# sleeptracker

Simple alarm clock app with some additional functionality. Set number of hours that you want to sleep for and the app will alert you
when you need to sleep to wake up at your desired time.

Goal functionality - set 3 goals for the next day. You will be reminded of your goals at intervals during the day if you have not checked
that they have been completed.

WIP - app still needs lots of testing
